## Minutes
The meeting began with a brief introduction of each participant.
During this phase, everyone shared their experiences and personal use of Kubernetes.
The primary motivation behind these meetings stems from the need to delve deeper into the use of Kubernetes for various projects and the desire to accelerate the learning phase through a series of discussions and sharing.

A significant part of the discussion revolved around the specific use of Kubernetes in certain contexts.
For instance, the use of Kubernetes in bare metal environments and the Cluster API Project were cited as examples of how Kubernetes can be extended and utilized in diverse scenarios.
During the discussion, a comparison was also made between the Cluster API and Ansible, highlighting how the Cluster API offers an approach more oriented towards Kubernetes, while Ansible primarily relies on SSH.

The conversation then shifted to the programming language Go.
Many participants stated they had basic or no proficiency in Go, but some shared their experiences in programming Kubernetes resources, particularly mentioning the Crownlabs project.
Crownlabs uses Kubernetes as its backend, with a middleware that converts GraphQL calls to Kubernetes' REST API.
Interested participants were advised to consult the Crownlabs repository on Github for further details.

Regarding the format and objectives of future meetings, the proposed idea is to follow an approach similar to Isovalent's, organizing periodic live streams and sharing material online.
There was also a discussion on how to organize upcoming meetings, with the intent to further introduce Kubernetes, discuss programming in Go, and delve into the creation of operators.
The idea of having an agenda with the topics of the day and clearly defining the requirements to participate in the calls was proposed.

Lastly, the methodology and format of future calls were discussed.
The idea is to alternate between theoretical moments, practical labs, and hands-on sessions.
It is planned to provide documentation and references for programming in Go and to adopt a slower format, with moments of sharing and frontal lessons.
Q&A sessions will be a key element, with two distinct moments: one to discuss previous doubts and another to address newly presented information.
Tools like Slack are expected to be used to gather questions and address the most relevant ones during the call.
